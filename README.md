# my_first_repo
Hello github users and browsers :)

This repo is being used to further understad Git and Github's enviroment and how to better up my python skills. 
I'll be uploading other repos to keep up with projects that I learnt the language and other technologies through and hopefully end up working on my own project eventually. 

Documenting the progress i Have made with git and github as follows:
1) I know now that Git is used to save repos locally on my machine while Github is mainly used as a distributing platform for teams to work on projects.
2) I know now how to initate a repo locally and then upload it on Github.
3) I know now how to add a file to staging and then commit it. ex: first_file.txt containing "Hello"
4) next, I'm going to edit "first_file.txt" by renaming it and add more text into.
5) next, I'm going to create another txt file and commit it into the same repo.
6) next, I'm going to learn about Branching/
